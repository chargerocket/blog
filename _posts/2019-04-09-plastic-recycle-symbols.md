Hopefully you have seen them and are coming here to find out what they mean, but for those of you who haven't seen them, the plastic recycle symbol on the bottom of virtually all plastics is a Resin Identification Code from the ASTM International Resin Identification Coding System. Basically, it let's you know what kind of plastic you are holding in your responsible recycler hands. Here's a quick break down:

| Symbol (Number inside Arrows) | Material                        | Recyclable in your city?  | 
| ------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1                             | Polyethylene terephthalate      | Most likely               | 
| 2                             | High-density polyethylene       | Maybe                     |
| 3                             | Polyvinyl chloride              | Probably Not *            |
| 4                             | Low-density polyethylene        | Probably Not              |
| 5                             | Polypropylene                   | Maybe                     |
| 6                             | Polystyrene                     | Probably Not              |
| 7                             | Other                           | Probably Not              |
* Note: Europe does. Why don't we (we as in US).

| Symbol (Number inside Arrows) | Consumer Examples                                           | 
| ------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1                             | Water bottles, the cup holding your boba tea                | 
| 2                             | Some 3D filament, bottle caps, plastic bags                 |
| 3                             | PVC plumbing pipes, fencing, shower curtains                |
| 4                             | Plastic bags, six pack plastic rings                        |
| 5                             | Stuff with living hinges, coolers                           |
| 6                             | Horrific packing peanuts, styrofoam containers              |
| 7                             | Everything else, kinda. PLA, polycarbonate, acrylic, etc.   |

So, I know the "Maybe," and "Most Likely" and other categorization I used is not entirely clear, but neither is how your plastics should be recycled in your community. Different communities have different rules. Some communities have recyclers willing to take certain plastics and others won't touch it. Basically, `you need to find out what YOUR specific community` will take or not take. That's basically the take away from this post. It doesn't matter what symbol, what number, what wording is on the bottom of your boba tea or cup from Starbucks. It really depends on what your waste management facility will process and what it will not.

Also, it will not matter if your waste management facility will take PET 1 cups if that particular cup is covered with some kind of `contaminant`. And by contaminant, I'm not talking Plutonium or your neighbor's blood (and I REALLY don't want to know why your neighbor's blood is on that cup), although that is sure as all heck to qualify as a contaminant in every sense of the word, but I'm talking about mundane stuff like food. Yes, if said cup is covered with food and it's PET 1 and normally the facility recycles PET 1 then there is still a good chance it won't get recycled. Please read [this post][recycling-wrong] if this is a surprise as you are doing it wrong.

More importantly, what about some of the plastic you have come across or is sitting in your home right now with no available RIC on the bottom? I speak of things like those Ziploc bags you have everywhere, storing all sorts of knick knacks. What is the RIC for Ziploc bags? Well, it depends, but if you are using [this][ziploc-material] one then it's a RIC of 4. Anyways, here are some other plastics and there codes that aren't so obvious:

| Consumer Examples             | RIC                                           | 
| ------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Ziploc bags                   | Most are probably a 4                         | 
| Plastic forks                 | Most are probably a 6                         |
| Plastic gelato tasting spoon  | Most are probably a 6                         |
| Plastic garbage bags          | Most are probably a 2 or 4                    |
