Hopefully you have seen them and are coming here to find out what they mean, but for those of you who haven't seen them, the plastic recycle symbol on the bottom of virtually all plastics is a Resin Identification Code from the ASTM International Resin Identification Coding System. Basically, it let's you know what kind of plastic you are holding in your responsible recycler hands. Here's a quick break down:

| Symbol (Number inside Arrows) | Material                        | Recyclable in your city?  | 
| ------------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------|
| 1                             | Polyethylene terephthalate      | Most likely               | 
| 2                             | High-density polyethylene       | Maybe                     |
| 3                             | Polyvinyl chloride              | Probably Not *            |
| 4                             | Low-density polyethylene        | Probably Not              |
| 5                             | Polypropylene                   | Maybe                     |
| 6                             | Polystyrene                     | Probably Not              |
| 7                             | Other                           | Probably Not              |
