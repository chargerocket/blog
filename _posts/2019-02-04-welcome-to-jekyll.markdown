It seems pretty surreal as I sit here writing what will be our first post here at ChargeRocket. As I look back, this is something like my 5th business that I have started, and though the trepidation of launching a business isn't as much a cause of concern, the excitement is still there just as if it were my first. With ChargeRocket, the excitement is even more so, as I feel there is great promise in the mission and ultimate goal we are going to strive to fulfill. I feel the outlook is amazing and I would like to tell you why.

But first, a bit of a background of how things got started. Recently, I have been following the YouTube channel for [Dave Hakkens][dave-hakkens] of [Precious Plastic][precious-plastic] and what an inspiring and eye-opening experience it has been to see the amazing things Dave is doing. Please, if you get the chance, take a look at his channel. I have also been in the process of developing some electronic products for the past year to year and a half with some friends and now fellow business partners. 

At one point, I decided that if I were to enter the electronic retail business that it would only seem like the responsible course would be to ensure that our products were sustainable and didn't add to some of the huge problems our society faces today. One of these enormous and critical issues is plastic. As everyone who uses any amount of consumer electronics will know, they are almost always made with a virgin plastic enlosure. And this is where ChargeRocket wants to diverge. Instead of adding to the disposable waste of plastic that plagues our city's landfill, especially now that we can't just conveniently put it on a boat and send it off `somewhere`, as this practice has been all but eliminated as a choice, we are choosing to do something entirely different. We want to REDUCE plastic in our landfills with each product by using recycled plastic and implementing a program by which we will take `all` of our products back to recycle ourselves responsibly and even some of everyone else's stuff.

Those are just the broad strokes of our plan. There are so many other details we wish to implement, but we are still trying to figure them out in their totality. Electronics in general, especially with the current culture of easy disposal, is a `mammoth` problem. Studies have pegged electronics waste as one of the fastest growing categories in our landfills and is going to be quite complex and difficult to solve. There are some promising solutions and we are looking into a couple in order to use for ChargeRocket.

All in all, we feel that whatever products you introduce into the world, as a business, you are responsible for they ultimately will affect our landfills and environment. Each business should strive to be responsible for their own products and maybe this can be part of the overall solution. We surely aren't the only ones and I am truly inspired by many companies that are doing a heck of job of policing not only their products, but in some cases their whole industry.

I know this is going to be weird writing this as one of the founders, but I don't think we are all that unique and ground-breaking. Although there really aren't that many consumer electronics businesses taking care of their own waste from their products (there really should be a whole lot more), there actually are other great businesses and people doing so right now. Like [these guys][fairphone] and even Apple seems to be doing some kickass stuff [according to GreenPeace][greenpeace-report]. We just don't want to be the ones sitting on the sidelines and would like to do our part.

So, if you are reading this, keep tuned and sign up for our newsletter if you are interested in what we are cooking up. Most importantly stay around to hear about our first product announcement!
