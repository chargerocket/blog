So, Winter is Coming, and here you are with your sad looking recycling bin and it's all wrong. The Others take you my friend! And by Others, I don't mean [Resin Identification Code 7][resin-codes]!! My friend, most likely you know nothing when it comes to what goes in that dark receptacle of doom.

OK, so that was a lot of references to GoT, but I couldn't resist as the last season nears! Anyways, I was at my mom's house the other day and as always happens at my mom's house, my mom was busy washing a bunch of recyclables -- especially plastic receptacles. My mom has done this for years, but the other day it finally struck me that my mom has been doing it `right` all along and me, well, I've been doing it all wrong. I knew nothing.

Lately, I have been reading a lot about plastics and also watching a lot of great videos on the subject. What I have learned is that I really was just sleep-walking through my entire recycling experience. Daily, I was just throwing items in the recycling bin that I `thought` were recyclable, but I was so wrong.

A quick primer: wash your recyclables and definitely don't allow food waste in your recycling bin, check with your waste facility before you throw the `trash bag` out `with` the recycling stuff, those arrows used in the RIC are deceptive as many facilities only recycle maybe 2 categories -- most won't mess with 6 or 7, some facilities don't except any plastic bags (mine doesn't), CHECK with your facility to find out exactly what will be recycled.

Here I was throwing pizza boxes after pizza boxes in the recycling bin, but in almost every case in which I did this, I was wrong. There haven't been many pizza boxes that have gone through our household without cheese and sauce stuck to it and that's where my knowledge had failed me. Once that cheese was stuck to that box, it was contaminated.
