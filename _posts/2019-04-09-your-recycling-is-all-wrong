So, Winter is Coming, and here you are with your sad looking recycling bin and it's all wrong. The Others take you my friend! And by Others, I don't mean [Resin Identification Code 7][resin-codes]!! My friend, most likely you know nothing when it comes to what goes in that dark receptacle of doom.

OK, so that was a lot of references to GoT, but I couldn't resist as the last season nears! Anyways, I was at my mom's house the other day and as always happens at my mom's house, my mom was busy washing a bunch of recyclables -- especially plastic receptacles. My mom has done this for years, but the other day it finally struck me that my mom has been doing it `right` all along and me, well, I've been doing it all wrong. I knew nothing.

Lately, I have been reading a lot about plastics and also watching a lot of great videos on the subject. What I have learned is that I really was just sleep-walking through my entire recycling experience. Daily, I was just throwing items in the recycling bin that I `thought` were recyclable, but how I was wrong.
